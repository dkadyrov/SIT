  <h3>Welcome, CS-554 students!</h3>

  <p>
    This starter project will allow you to see a few common Ionic patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd notice, the source for this page has an ion-header with an ion-navbar; that informs Ionic that if this is not the root page of the application to show a back button to navigate through the history backwards and go back to the previous component rendererd.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also notice the menuToggle attribute on the button in the ion-header; that will allow us to toggle the sidemenu, which is rendered in the app component.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fun fact! The app component is still loaded, however Ionic navigates similar to a stack; it is simple on an entry somewhere below this one, waiting to be rendered again.

  <p>
    <button ion-button color="primary" menuToggle>Toggle Menu</button>
  </p>

</ion-content>
