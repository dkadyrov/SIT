  "biography": "My name is Daniel Kadyrov. I am 26 years old. I live in New York City and commute to Hoboken for my job at Stevens Institute of Technology because they pay me well and I get the perks of taking classes. This summer semester I am taking CS550, where I have to learn about a little man computer, and CS546, where I am currently writing an server using Express JS. \n In the mornings I wake up at 8: 00 AM.I make coffee in mocha pot.Right now I am drinking Costco 's Kirkland Cuban coffee and its really good. Around 9: 00 AM, I start biking to the PATH train. I live in Harlem so my bike ride takes me through Central Park, down Broadway, to Herald Square. I take the PATH train and then ride the scenic Hudson River route up to the SIT campus.",
