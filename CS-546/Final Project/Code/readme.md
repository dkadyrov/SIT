## Accomplishments 

### Core Features

[x] A user can search for posts, and if the term appears in the title or description then it will be shown
[x] The main page of the website will show the last 10 posts made, and allow user to scroll back in history to see all posts (from most to least recent), 10 at a time
[x] A user can favorite posts that other users have created, and can go to a page where they can see a list of their favorited posts

## Extra Features
[ ] Users can edit their profile information, like name, email, password, proÙè∞Çle picture after account creation
[x] Identicon will be created users who did not provide profile picture.
[x] Users can delete their own posts


## Changes from Original Proposal: 

API routes are provided to manage users, posts, and likes. 

The posts database data has been changed: 

```JSON
{
    "id": "post id"
    "title": "title of post", 
    "author": {
        "_id": "user._id", 
        "username": "username",
        "picture": "picture",
    },
    "content": "content of post", 
    "type": "type of post", 
    "url": "url of content"
}
```

Although the author id and username are used for display and redirection purposes, I did not use the picture parameter. I updated it because initially I wanted to show the profile picture with each blog post on the home page but it became too clustered during my preliminary implementation. 

## Future Development Goals

- Finish extra features
- Extend search features
- Lock API use to access with API key
- Continue working on the UX design such as making it mobile-friendly, fixing possible sizing issues. Choose better colors.
