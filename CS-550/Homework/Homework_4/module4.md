# What is (are) the floating-point numbers?

Floating point numbers are digital representations of real numbers that contain a decimal fraction up to a certain precision. The maximum range of significant digits a personal computer can handle is +-[10^{-38} < number < 10^{38}]. Higher amounts of significant digits, especially when performing calculations, results in larger storage requirements and slower calculations with a possiblity of loss of precision. 

Floating point numbers are handled through exponential notation and defined through a standard format. The format includes the exponent and its sign as well as the mantissa and its sign.
