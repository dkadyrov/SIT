#7) Briefly describe four advantages of clustering computers.

Clusters are computers, individually called nodes, coupled as a unit to work together. The first advantage of clustering is increased computational power than that of an individual combined system. The computational power is also able to be proportionally increased in scale with more nodes. The second advantage is the ability to mitigate risk since a failure in one node will not result in the failure of the system. Clustering does not mandate a similar geographical location, allowing the nodes to be scattered to different areas. By dispersing the nodes - the system will be less susceptible to geographic conditions such as power failure. Finally, clustering allows processing work loads to be divided amongst machines - resulting in decreased computational time.
