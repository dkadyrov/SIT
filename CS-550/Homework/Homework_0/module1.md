## Question 2: What is the difference between machine language and assembly language?

Machine language is a set of instructions that are encoded as bit patterns performed by the CPU (central processing unit) of a computer. The instructions can be from single to multiple bytes long depending on use and set by the instructor's op-code. The language is written in binary. Considered the first-generation of programming language. 

Assembly language use mnemonic expressions (letters, words) that convert through assembler programs into machine language. Descriptive variable names, identifiers, could be used to represent memory cells. An example could be using "Add" as an operational command. Considered second-generation of programming languages. 

Both machine and assembly languages are machine-dependent - based around the machines attributes (memory locations) so they have to be rewritten for a new computer's configuration.   

## Question 13: Please describe the basic building blocks that make up conventional systems: processors, memory, and I/O:

The building blocks of a conventional computer system are processors, memory, and input/output. 

The processor is the location of computational performance. The central processing unit (CPU) is made up of a control unit (CU), an arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), and an interface unit. The control unit oversees the processing of instructions in the logic unit and communicates the data through the interface unit to other hardware components.

Memory refers to storage of data. Primary storage, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), holds programs and data for quick access by the CPU. The data is represented in binary with the foundation unit of 8 bits (equivalent to 1 byte). Instructions for a program and the data that is being manipulated are stored in primary storage and brought in and executed in the CPU. Secondary storage, such as hard or solid state drives, are for long-term storage. 

Hardware such as keyboards, touchscreens, pointers (mice, joysticks), provide a way for a user to enter commands, text, and other data into the computer system. Output, such as printers, speakers, or visual screens, display the results of the program or instruction to the user.
