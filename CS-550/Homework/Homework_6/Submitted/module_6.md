2) How does the computer keep track of special conditions such as arithmetic carry and overflow, power failure, and internal computer error? (Section 7.2)

The computer keeps track of special conditions like carry and overflow, power failure, and internal computer errors as flags grouped together in status registers within the control unit of the CPU (Englander, 2014). The status register stores the specific flags in their respectively targetted location within a bit of the status register. For example, the Z flag, named the Zero flag, indicates that an operation resulted with a zero (The Status Register).
