1)  What are the three steps in pulse code modulation (PCM)? (Ch 14)

Pulse code modulation (PCM) is a way of converting data that is analog into a digital format. The analog waveform is sampled at a certain, regular, time-intervals and the maximum possible amplitude of the sample is converted to a corresponding umber value. These numbers are then converted to binary. A device that performs this operation is called a A-to-D, or analog to digital, converter.
