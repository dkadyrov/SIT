15) What is polling used for? What are the disadvantages of polling? What is a better way to perform the same job?

Polling is when a program uses programmed input-output (I/O) to determine the status of an I/O device by sending out requests. The I/O device returns a word description of the requested information in a message and must be frequently checked by the CPU so there is no lost data that is awaiting transfer. This is the disadvantage of polling since a CPU might waste processing power and time polling devices. A better alternative is using interrupts. \\
