# 31) What does OLED stand for? How does OLED technology differ from LCD technology?

OLED stands for Organic Light-Emitting Diode. OLED is a screen technology that uses a thin display panel containing red, green, and blue LEDs for each pixel with a transistor on each LED that generates electric current to light it. An input signal indicates the desired level of brightness to the transistor which supplies the amount of current to output the light. In this way, OLED technology is active while LCD monitors are passive since the light is generated by a backlight and the light is blocked by LCD cells in the panel. The brightness of the LCD is limited by the brightness of the backlight and the level of darkness is limited by light leakage from the cells. As a result, OLED technology provides a brighter image with more vivid and high contrast colors. OLED panels are thinner and consume less power than LCDs.
