# 23. What is an acyclic-graph directory?

An acyclic-graph directory is a type of tree-structured directory that allows links between seperate branches. In hierarchial directory, all directories stem from the root directory and their pathnames are relative to their position in the tree. In a acyclic-graph, the same file or subdirectory may be accessed in two different directories. Acyclic directories become useful in situations when two different users or computers need to access the same folder or files but within their own directories.
