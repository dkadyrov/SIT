\begin{problem}[1]
    Jerry and Susan have a joint bank account. Jerry goes to the bank 20\% of the days.
    Susan goes there 30\% of the days.
    Together they are at the bank 8\% of the days.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item Susan was at the bank last Monday. What is the probability that Jerry was there too?
        \item Last Friday, Susan was not at the bank. What's the probability that Jerry was there?
        \item Last Wednesday at least one of them was at the bank. What is the probability that both of them were there?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item $P(\text{Jerry at Bank} / \text{Susan at Bank}) = 8 \% / 30 \% = 26.67 \%$
        \item $P(\text{Jerry at Bank} / \text{Susan not at Bank}) = 12 \% / 70 \% = 17.14 \%$
        \item $P(\text{Jerry $\cap$ Susan at Bank} / \text{Jerry $\cup$ Susan at Bank}) = 8 \% / (1 - 58\%) = 19.05 \%$

\begin{problem}[2]
    Harold and Sharon are studying for a test. Harold`s chances of getting a ``B'' are 80\%. Sharon's chances of getting a ``B'' are 90\%. The probability of at least one of them getting a ``B'' is 91\%.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item What is the probability that only Harold gets a ``B''?
        \item What is the probability that only Sharon gets a ``B''?
        \item What is the probability that both won't get a ``B''?

    \end{aligned}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item $P(\text{Only Harold ``B''}) = P(\text{Harold ``B''}) - P(\text{Harold ``B'' $\cap$ Sharon not ``B''}) = 80 \% - 79 \% = 1 \%$
        \item $P(\text{Only Sharon ``B''}) = P(\text{Sharon ``B''}) - P(\text{Sharon ``B'' $\cap$ Harold not ``B''}) = 90 \% - 79 \% = 11\%$

\begin{problem}[3]
    Jerry and Susan have a joint bank account. Jerry goes to the bank 20\% of the days. Susan goes there 30\% of the days. Together they are at the bank 8\% of the days. Are the events ``Jerry is at the bank'' and ``Susan is at the bank'' independent?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    By definition, two events are independent if and only if: 

    \begin{equation}
        P(A\text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
    \end{equation}

    In the situation described within the problem statement: 
    
    $$
        P(A\text{ and } B) = 8 \% \neq 20 \% \times 30 \% = 60 \%
    $$ 

    Therefore, the statements ``Jerry is at the bank'' and ``Susan is at the bank'' are dependent.
\end{solution}

        \item Are the events ``the sum is 7'' and ``the first die shows 5'' independent?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item The events ``the sum is 6'' and ``the second die shows 5'' are dependent. 
        $$
        P(\text{Sum is 6}) = n(\{(3,3), (2,4), (4,2), (1,5), (5,1)\})/36 = 5/36
        $$
        $$
        P(\text{Second die is 5}) = n(\{(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\})/36 = 6/36
        $$
        $$
        P(\text{Sum is 6 $\cap$ second die is 5}) = n(\{(1,5)\})/36 = 1/36
        $$
        $$
        1/36 \neq 5/36 \times 6/36 = 30/1296 = 5/216

        $$
        P(\text{Sum is 7}) = n(\{(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\}) = 6/36

\begin{problem}[5]
    An oil company is considering drilling in either TX, AK and NJ. The company may operate in only one state. There is 60\% chance the company will choose TX and 10\% chance - NJ. There is 30\% chance of finding oil in TX, 20\% - in AK, and 10\% - in NJ.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What's the probability of finding oil?
        \item The company decided to drill and found oil. What is the probability that they drilled in TX?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the probability that a passenger did not survive? 
        \item What is the probability that a passenger was staying in the first class?
        \item Given that a passenger survived, what is the probability that the passenger was staying in the first class?
        \item Are survival and staying in the first class independent?
        \item Given that a passenger survived, what is the probability that the passenger was staying in the first class and the passenger was a child?
